Current project objectives:
Allow homeless youths to create an account and profile, which gives an opportunity for donors to donate money by using in-app currency.


Key users: 

Donors
Willow England is a 35-year-old woman with a high paid job. She is kindhearted and has plenty of savings. Since sheâ€™s used to having big transactions, she has the habit of using debit/credit cards.
She is up to date on a lot of new technologies and is very tech savvy. Although she pays little attention walking down the sidewalk, she sees a lot of homeless youth near the downtown area and occasionally stops to donate money to them when she has time. She has been ridiculed by her friends before when donating, as her friends fear the money she gives will be misused to buy alcohol. 

Homeless youths
Abby Smith is an 18-year-old highschool dropout and both of her parents passed away due to a car accident when she was 3 and has been suffering depression since then. She likes to dance. Abby wishes to spend her money on necessities but often struggles with financial difficulty. Abby has an old phone but does not have access to computers.

Scenarios: 
Allow donors to transfer money into the in app currency which homeless youths can use.
Allow homeless youths to set up their accounts and profiles.
Allow donors to read the background of homeless youths and understand their struggles.

Principles:
The design should ensure that the in app currency is used for necessities but not for other goods. (can only be used to buy good from participating locations i.e. cannot use currency at LCBO)
