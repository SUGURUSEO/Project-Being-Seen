# Motivation: 
The project aims to create an app that helps homeless youth by removing certains stigmas of donating to the homeless, such as the stigma that homeless youths might use the money to purchase alcohol rather than paying off their loans/mortgages.   
We aim to create an app with its own internal currency that can only be used at certain stores.   
We aim to work with certain restaurant chains/groceries stores that will accept this currency, so that donors will be certain their charitable donation can only be spent on specific locations (i.e Tim hortons/ Walmarts)

# Contribution: 
describe the process for contributing to your project.   

### Do you use git flow?
We will follow the process of gitflow where we create new branches based on features, we will have to create a branch for master, development and features.   

### What do you name your branches?
master: for master branch (current working version)   
dev: for development branch (for current development branch that will be merged into master)   
feature-myNewFeatureName: for a new feature branch this branch will not be edited. We will only merge to this branch via the branch below   (if both child feature branches require a method.. U1 stash the non-related changes, commit the method all child branches needs, other child branches pull changes..  U1 gets their stash back)    
feature-myNewFeatureName-NameOfUser: feature branch being worked on by NameOfUser, allowing for cleaner commits (discuss with people working on the same features before committing/PR)   Comment all code before PR with feature branch   
hotfix-newHotfixIssueName: for urgent hotfix that is in master branch

### Do you use github issues or another ticketing website?
We use discord / Jira to ticket our issues 

### Do you use pull requests?
Yes, it is mandatory to use PR before merging branches unless it is an urgent hotfix
