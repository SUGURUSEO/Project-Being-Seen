# Difference between our product:
Our app aims to break common stigmas about donating to the homeless. There is a common stigma that if we donate currency to homeless youths, they may use the money to buy alcohol and drugs rather than using it to better their lives. Our app aims to create its own internal currency that can only be used in participating restaurants/convenience stores, therefore donors will know their donations can’t be used to purchase unintended products like alcohol.

There is no current app with a similar premise in Canada, our app aims to focus on Toronto at first and expand to Ontario/Canada in the future
