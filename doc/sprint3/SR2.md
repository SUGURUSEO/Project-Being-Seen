Meeting up for sprint 2 retrospective conducted on Oct 25 (Discord) Participants: Suguru Seo, Jiaxuan Zhang, Pengpeng Cao, 
Hong Sung Ye Ansel, Andreas Alexander Hsu Shen Lee, Sarina Pui Ting Cheung


Things we did well from Sprint 2:
- Task division was clear and everybody knows what they should do
- We managed to complete assigned tasks without issues (even though some tasks were simplified).
- Managed to work efficiently throughout reading week despite having midterms.
- Communication was better than sprint1 and good overall teamwork.
- Many people help each other and look after other tasks even not assigned in the beginning


Things we can improve on for future sprints:
- For some tasks, we end up working in a last minutes which we should improve for sprint3
- Schedule things clearly among different people and tasks, too many unused/duplicate codes
- Didn’t manage to merge all tasks together as planned before end of sprint 2.
- Before working on tasks, check if there were similar implementations.
- Mispredicted the poker values estimates for user stories.
- Had to spend some extra time to clean up sprint1 tasks (this will likely be better for sprint 3 due to less stuff to clean up)
- We might want to do PR after we complete one task(working code) (even if we’re at standup 1, or even if you’re not sure if it’s the final version) so that other people can 
- 1. understand what’s going on 
- 2. give advice if possible 
- 3. do less work when merging at the end of the sprint.



What we will do to improve:
- We aim to finish some important tasks before standup2 so that for standup 3, we can focu focus on merging frontend and backend
- More communication for preventing duplicate codes
- Backend has to be discussed before anybody working on backend  before the first standup
- Create documentation right away when API is made
- We make PR for ideally every standup so other people can see other code before the last minutes (as long as code is workable)


TA Feedback from our Demo:
- Donation goal not visible under youth profile
- Have fields in input texts
- Have username of youth that donor is donating to instead of picture
- Title of pages should be "Page Name" instead of "Being Seen" for each specific screen
- Balance/Donation option in profile page should be tabs not switch
- The button color is still blending with background
