Daily Standups Sprint 3: Oct 29, Nov 1, Nov 4, 8am in Toronto time (Discord)

Team capacity should be optimal for sprint 3, but based on what we learned from Sprint 2 we definitely expect for minor issues to occur. 
However, we feel like most of the minor issues we would face were already fixed in sprint 2 and we expect better communication throughout the team. 
We decided to do about the same amount of work from sprint 2 because we felt it was the right amount, especially with some user stories that will reuse 
the code we already implemented from previous sprints.

Meeting goal: Finish all tasks breakdowns and assigning, choose which tasks to complete hopefully by end of sprint 3, identify spikes.

Potential spikes: Connecting backend to frontend for new features, creating a navigation bar to reduce clutter, finding out how we will do the real life money payments.

Sprint goal: At the end of Sprint3, we will focus on improving the UI, as well as creating accounts for merchants, Being Seen adminds and large organizations for our app. We aim to complete 
user stories 18, 47, 91, 95, 96, 97, 102 which allows the three new types of users to use our app and for youth to spend their in-app currency, and for donors to see
specific donation goal pages, as well as a better UI with navigation bar. We decided to work on these because allowing the youth to use our app to purchase neccessities is
a core feature for our app, so we will try to focus on that as well as a better overall user experience for our app.
